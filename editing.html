					<h2>Video Editing</h2>
					<p>During the Coronavirus Crisis, we have found ourselves spending a lot more time at home. I have spent some of this time teaching myself video editing using using Adobe Premiere Pro. So far I have made a variety of videos on "League of Legends", a game I enjoy playing/watching with my friends. These videos can be found on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaI3gLvO4wRARPDUxyo0VSQ"  target="_blank">Youtube Channel</a> </br></br> I am by no means an expert, and I am well aware that I have a lot to improve on <strong>but I don't see as a weakness.</strong> I genuinely enjoy spending my personal time trying to learn and at the end of the day, I am doing it for fun.</br></br><i>Here I have picked out some of my favourites:</i></p>

								<h3>Anything is Possible - LEC at Worlds (Moments and Memories)</h3>
							</header>
							<p><h5>A love letter to EU teams at worlds and some of my favourite memories from watching over the years.</h5>
							Since I am an esports fanatic, my free time in November is filled with enjoying the League of Legends world championships.
                            As a passionate fan of the European region, the "LEC", I wanted to cut together some content that showed some of the storylines for European teams at worlds.
                            This is my favourite video I have put together as well as my most "successful" video sitting on a humble 800 views after it was initially uploaded and shared onto reddit.</br></br>
                            It's not much, but for a channel with only 30 subscribers I was quite pleased with myself.

								<h3>The Masterplan - Yone Ashe Botlane </h3>
							</header>
							<p><h5>As well as more serious videos about esports, I also try to make my friends laugh by editing highlights from our games.</h5>
							A slight change of pace from my esports related edits, these videos are not to be taken especially seriously. I was interested in making some comedy style clips featuring my own games with friends where we mess around trying unconventional playstyles and making fun of each other.
                            </br></br>
                            I would often lose hours at a time without realising while I was teaching myself how to motion track for the sake of some of the goofy jokes that feature in these videos; as with all my content I realise it has a lot of room for improvement but I am still working on learning as I go.

								<h3>Flex queue is for Flexing but will Scott be Inting?</h3>
							</header>
							<p><h5>During the early stages of the Coronavirus crisis, I enjoyed streaming Games of "Flex Queue" with my friends.</h5>
							After streaming, I would download the footage from twitch. After this I could then spend some time making edits for my own amusement (with the consent of the people featured, who also got a kick out of it).
                            </br></br>
                            This one is based around and features music/video from the Worlds music video "Phoenix", which is based around the idea of overcoming self doubt as a professional esports player. The joke here being that I am not very good at the game.

								<h3>Farewell Rekkles! (Moments and Memories)</h3>
							</header>
							<p><h5>Another entry into "Moments and Memories", this time reflecting on one of my favourite players.</h5>
							I remember when I was still in high school, probably around 2014, a friend of mine suggested that me and my friends went to see a documentary about esports in the local cinema. Up until then I had
                            never really heard of esports but I did play the game on my own time and was interested.
                            We found ourselves in an empty cinema screening, since I suppose nobody in Glasgow at the time was all that interested. 
                           </br></br>

                            Anyway, the point of this story is that the documentary focused on a young new player for EU team Fnatic - "Rekkles". After years of watching Rekkles play, Fnatic announced his departure to rival team G2
                            in 2021, I wanted to make another video to celebrate some of the memories of watching games over the years.
