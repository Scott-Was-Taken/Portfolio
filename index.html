						<h2>Ambitious Technology professional with experience in a range of environments.</h2>
						<p> I am an ambitious DevOps Engineer currently enjoying the opportunity to work on exciting projects across Retail Insight’s various products.
							When I was at university I enjoyed meeting new people and working with teams
							to overcome challenges on group coursework and finding the right balance between work and play. In my free time I formed the University’s
							first NUEL e-Sports team in my first few weeks of study.</br></br>

							My roles at John Lewis have given me broad experience in working efficiently in various retail environments including brand experience,
							sales and security. I value my personal development in each of these roles since these areas each came with their own set of challenges.
							I have also spent time working in a tech startup environment at Frog Systems as well as working in my local authority's IT department giving me
							perspective on the challenges faced in these contrasting environments. <br />
