						<h2>Ambitious computing graduate with experience in a range of environments.</h2>
						<p>I am a recent graduate from Glasgow Caledonian University studying Bsc(Hons) Computing having achieved a 2;1.
							Throughout my course I have enjoyed meeting new people and working with teams
							to overcome challenges on group coursework. In my free time I formed the Universityâ€™s
							first NUEL e-Sports team in my first few weeks of study.</br></br>

							My roles at John Lewis have given me broad experience in working efficiently in various retail environments including brand experience,
							sales and security. I value my personal development in each of these roles since these areas each came with their own set of challenges.
							I have also spent time working in a tech startup environment at Frog Systems as well as working in my local authority's IT department giving me
							perspective on the challenges faced in these contrasting environments. <br />

								<h3>Earthquake Tracker Android App</h3>
							</header>
							<p><h5>Earthquake tracker app created for Mobile Platform Development elective module</h5>
							In my mobile platform development elective class I was tasked with creating an android application that reads earthquake data from the British Geological Survey API
							and displays it in a user friendly way. I opted to use a <Strong>searchable list</Strong> as well as <Strong>Google maps API</Strong> to help with this.</br></br>

								<h3>Music App</h3>
							</header>
							<p><h5>Music App</h5>
							In my own time I have created a simple Java application that reads data from a delimited text file and stores this in an <Strong>SQL database.</Strong> This can
							then be accessed from a web app that makes use of <Strong>PHP</Strong> to query the database and retrieve objects in <Strong>JSON format.</Strong>
							This is then displayed in a user searchable HTML table</br></br>
