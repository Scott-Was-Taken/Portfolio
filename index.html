						<h2>Ambitious Technology professional in Glasgow with experience in a range of environments.</h2>
						<p> I am an ambitious DevOps Engineer currently enjoying the opportunity to work on exciting projects across Retail Insight’s various products.
							When I was at university I enjoyed meeting new people and working with teams
							to overcome challenges on group coursework while finding the right balance between work and play. In my free time I formed the University’s
							first NUEL esports team in my first few weeks of study.</br></br>

							My roles at John Lewis have given me broad experience in working efficiently in various retail environments including brand experience,
							sales and security. I value my personal development in each of these roles since these areas each came with their own set of challenges.
							I have also spent time working in a tech startup environment at Frog Systems as well as working in my local authority's IT department giving me
							perspective on the challenges faced in these contrasting environments. Most recently, my role at Retail Insight has allowed me to develop interpersonal
                            and organisational skills, as well as increasing my technical knowledge.<br />
